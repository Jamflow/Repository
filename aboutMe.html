        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <div id="aboutMeText">
        <p> My name is Jamar Pagpaguitan, but I also goes by JP.
        I'm currently a Highschool senior attending Summit Shasta Public School 
        in Daly City, California. As far as my life has gone, I have only 
        travelled domestically in the United States, including Las Vegas, 
        Hawai'i, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and all over California. I was 
        born in San Francisco, but I've moved all over the Bay Area, Las Vegas, and 
        finally settling in South San Francisco by the start of Junior High. Living 
        in one of the most multiculturally diverse places in the world, I'm Filipino.</p>
        <p>I own Summit Shasta's Film Club along with senior Jonathan Rodriguez. 
        Some of the things I love include film, art, boxing, sailing, coding,
        drawing, and construction. In particular, I am presently pursuing art and boxing.</p>
        <p>From art, it's been a hobby for me to draw as I've been drawing since the age of 3 and
        like to express my perspective, issues, and life. I love drawing in general, from portraits 
        to buildings and symbols to murals.</p>
        <p>After highschool, I would like to attend California State University Maritime Academy 
        and major in Facilities Engineering Technology or otherwise simply Mechanical Engineering 
        in another affordable and beneficial in-state college.</p>
