        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p> My name is Jamar Pagpaguitan, but I also goes by JP.
        I am currently a Highschool Senior attending Summit Shasta Public School 
        in Daly City, California. As far as my life has gone, I have only 
        travelled domestically in the United States, including Las Vegas, 
        Hawai'i, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and all over California. I was 
        born in San Francisco, but I've moved all over the Bay Area, as well as in Las Vegas, and 
        finally settling in South San Francisco by the 5th grade. Living in one of the most diverse
        places in the world, I'm ironically a Filipino vegetarian Buddhist.</p>
        <p>Speaking of food as a vegetarian, I'm honestly not picky, and no, I 
        don't just eat tofu and lettuce and can also eat cheese and dairy, otherwise
        I'd be a starving vegan. For me, there's a fine line between my favorite foods being
        local Mexican taqueria burritos versus Thai Pad See Ew. Because I go out,
        what better reason is there than food?</p>
        <p>A favorite hobby of mine is to draw as I've been drawing since the age of 3 and
        like to express my culture, perspective, issues, and life. Drawing to me was the
        only thing that could kick into the creativity of a kid who moved alot. I love drawing
        portraits of people as well as sketch murals of symbols of expression.</p>
