        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Jamar Pagpaguitan, but I also goes by JP.
        I am currently a Highschool Senior attending Summit Shasta Public School 
        in Daly City, California. As far as my life has gone, I have only 
        travelled domestically in the United States, including Las Vegas, 
        Hawai'i, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and all over California. I was 
        born in San Francisco, moving all over the Bay Area, Las Vegas, and 
        finally settling in South San Francisco. Living in one of the most diverse
        places I know of, I'm ironically a Filipino vegetarian Buddhist.</p>
        <p>Speaking of food as a vegetarian, I'm honestly not picky, and no, I 
        don't just eat tofu and lettuce. I can also eat cheese and dairy, or else
        I'd be a starving vegan. I have a fine line between cheesy Lasagna (without meat)
        and local Mexican taqueria Burritos. With noodles, I love </p>
