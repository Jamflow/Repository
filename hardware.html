            hard drives are mainly used to store large amounts of data in digital systems. They hold your day-to-day operating systems, 
            executable programs, and files such as images, music, and everything dandy to you until they are removed/deleted.</p>

            and allows all communication between the principal components of a system, 
            such being the CPU, RAM, and graphics card slots. It is also reffered to as the 
            mainframe or body of a system.<br /><br />BUS: Also called the "Data Highway", those thin lines all over the motherboard are
            bus. They are simply physical connections that can be in the form of cables and printed circuits, allowing communication between one component 
            to another as data travels at a speed measured in megahertz (MHz).</p>

            of a computer, this is where instructions sent from components and programs that are calculated using 
            basic arithmetic (binary), then processed to enable the system to perform functions. </p>

            memory used by a system to store data for the CPU to process. As it is the main memory of a system, the is temporary workspace
            for interacting with processed data and executing instructions. This memory is temporary and "random-accessed" for it's capability
            of accessing any single byte. Byte addressability is different for systems depending on the type of storage devices connected such as hard disks and flash
            drives.</p>
